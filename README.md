# Gatsby Build Newrelic

Using Gatsby to deliver large websites can speed up end usersâ€™ experiences. However, as those projects scale, many development teams are slowed down by long build times. The `gatsby-build-newrelic` plugin provides instant observability into the entire Gatsby build process, exporting vital telemetry data from within the belly of the beast. With events, metrics, logs, and traces, we are able to contextualize and identify performance issues within our plugins, 3rd party APIs, and other parts of our website.
